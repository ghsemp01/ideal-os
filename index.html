	<h1>Basic Features</h1>
	<h3>Process Scheduling</h3>
	<p><strong>Enhance RR</strong></p>
	<p>
		This is an enhance round robin algorithm for real time processing of CPU request. It slices the process into much smaller pieces
		 and process each part of it, not in milliseconds but in nanoseconds creating an illusion that all request are process simultaneously 
	</p>
	<p><strong>Hybrid scheduling</strong></p>
	<p>
		In case of very limited CPU power, the OS will not use the Enhance RR. The OS will use the Hybrid scheduling algorithm which automatically 
		detects the best algorithm that will cater the needs of the request. It will combine two or more scheduling algorithms like FCFS,
		SJF, RR and will assigned the necessary priority base on process types like system process, user process etc...
	</p>
	<h3>Deadlocks</h3>
	<p><strong>Starveless algorithm</strong></p>
	<p>
		Enhance RR will not produce deadlocks, resources are never fully taken by the process, rather it just took a part of it at a time.
		  Because of this, any other process will have the ability to request for that resources and never starve.
	</p>
	<h3>IO</h3>
	<p><strong>Handless control</strong></p>
	<p>
		The OS can be fully operated using voice command. 
	</p>
	<p><strong>Facial Recognition / Voice recognition login</strong></p>
	<p>
		Login through the OS by scanning your face or by saying a certain phrase.
	</p>
	<p><strong>Voice to text </strong></p>
	<p>
		Any time your cursor place on text fields like notepad, word documents, web address bar, google search, the OS will detects
		that you want to type something so it will convert your voice into text only if you activate this features. External voices will
		not be process because the OS will smartly know the distance of the actual user.
	</p>
	<p><strong>Screen projection</strong></p>
	<p>
		The OS will have a built in projector that can be used to project anything that is on your screen.
